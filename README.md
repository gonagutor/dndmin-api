# DnDmin API
This is an API made with Node.js and MongoDB for my DnDmin APP

## Why I made this?
The current api that the app is using is made in PHP (using symphony) and is using MySQL. 
I think that MongoDB is a better database for this project.
I also have never touched Node.js or MongoDB and I think it is time to learn.

The data is not included in the database, only the schemas
